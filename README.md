# NewSplashScreen
The New Splash Screen API

https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/splash-screen

Android 12 adds the SplashScreen API, which enables a new app launch animation for all apps when running on a device with Android 12 or higher. This includes an into-app motion at launch, a splash screen showing your app icon, and a transition to your app itself.
